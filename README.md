<p style="width:100px;">The aim of this master's thesis was to implement and test the NAPES runtime for Android, which is designed to emulate network traffic similar to that generated by any IoT application, using TCP and UDP protocols. NAPES loads the configurations defined in the RCR (Runtime Component Representation) components and based on the given parameters, starts emulating network traffic. This solution allows to test selected IoT networks for their performance and the ability to adapt to new changes in the network (e.g., adding a new node to the configured network). For this purpose, NAPES performs a state machine simulation and, according to the current state of the system, a network flow with appropriate parameters is generated. The conditions for changing states in the state machine are application events that have been implemented using the MQTT protocol.</p>
